# SBCOTTON HACKATHON 2019
##        MY JOB

> I participated in SBCOTTON HACKATHON on april 12, 13 and 14. I joined the backend team to use the data from the web and chage it to different format and upload it to S3 on Amazon Web Services . The data were in the csv file and excel file. I uploaded the data in the VS Code and wrote the function to chage the data in the csv file and excel file into json format. The functions were then uploaded  to the S3 bucket using Lambda in the Amazon Web Services. When the data were to be converted were uploaded into the S3 bucket on the same folder, the data were changed into json format and the formatted data were retrived from the cloudwatch of amazon web services.
